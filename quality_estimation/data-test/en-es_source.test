When Fein asked about the forms Friday, Manning acknowledged that he rated treatment by his guards as "excellent" and treatment by the facility overall as "very professional."
Manning responded that he would verbally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed, but they didn't record the issues.
Manning was moved to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
The defense has said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to lesser offenses and fight other charges as being too extreme.
If he's convicted on all counts, he could face a life sentence.

Yeah.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Amid the usual futile arguments over who started it, scores of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to back off, even though Gaza has taken a drubbing.
Moreover, Hamas's leaders may well conclude that time is on their side.
Meanwhile, Israel's hardliners will draw the opposite conclusions.
Why coddle those twisty Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?

First of all, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively recent phenomenon, with the advent of more leisure time.
After looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "wanting to, but being unable to engage in satisfying activity."
Boredom can sound an awful lot like depression.
If you're bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
Nor should we be too critical of it.
But prosecutors in more conservative precincts in Colorado have vowed to press ahead with existing marijuana cases and are still citing people for possession.
They say that Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now recreationally.
Chief Oates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical marijuana growers, and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
Right now, 119 people face charges of possessing two ounces or less of marijuana, though many are facing other charges.
Yes, ran, because I had been subject to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Well, recent reports suggest that a new generation of Right-of-centre students are suffering a similar persecution.

Even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but, to this day, hides behind an ill-deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
You will be getting to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novelistic telling, and this dramatis personae will function as your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, like one of his men and women, you are confused and bereft in the fog of war.

He describes "meat made of pressed rice boiled in mutton fat (and finished off with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato peel; shoes soled with wood."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American recognizes his own impulse toward savagery and declares about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men were intended for rather than to sit in easy chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, the evening paper or the best seller, and to pretend that such a veneer means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind your starched and studded shirt front."
Conversely a British soldier realizes that he will most likely die, and that no one will notice or care.
Other observations are about an old Europe falling away, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Mr. Englund writes, "a war between factories."
Mr. Englund discussed the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front.
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is supple but unshowy, perfectly suited to his humane task.
The best books about World War I have often been oblique, like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory," or novels, like Erich Maria Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front," rather than comprehensive histories.

The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including boroughwide task forces - scores of mobile officers who are usually used to flood high-crime neighborhoods.
The suit will list Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants, and counts eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latino women, as were most of the aides who lost their jobs.

In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat through a hearing before a judge, during which she was questioned about having had sex with her boyfriend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: he had spent much of the time leading up to his attack at his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social-networking sites.

Facebook's stash of personal information is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that the researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been doing for years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it lets you study people you couldn't approach with a clipboard on the street.
"We've found a way to identify kids at risk who would not otherwise be diagnosed." 
But Facebook's users know the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the trade off for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.

Scalia and Thomas dine with healthcare law challengers as court takes case
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court's conference over the case.
If they were, they arguably fell under code's Canon 4C, which states, "A judge may attend fund-raising events of law-related and other organizations although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or featured on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the sheer proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics-in-government activists.
Moreover, conservatives argue that it's Justice Elena Kagan who has an ethical issue, not Scalia and Thomas.

Luisa Maria Calderon alleges that drug traffickers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the governor's race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her bid for governor of Michoacan during violent state elections, and she alleged Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, looking ahead to next year."

When Fein asked about the forms Friday, Manning acknowledged that he rated treatment by his guards as "excellent" and treatment by the facility overall as "very professional."
Manning responded that he would verbally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed, but they didn't record the issues.
Manning was moved to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
The defense has said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to lesser offenses and fight other charges as being too extreme.
If he's convicted on all counts, he could face a life sentence.

Yeah.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Amid the usual futile arguments over who started it, scores of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to back off, even though Gaza has taken a drubbing.
Moreover, Hamas's leaders may well conclude that time is on their side.
Meanwhile, Israel's hardliners will draw the opposite conclusions.
Why coddle those twisty Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?

First of all, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively recent phenomenon, with the advent of more leisure time.
After looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "wanting to, but being unable to engage in satisfying activity."
Boredom can sound an awful lot like depression.
If you're bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
Nor should we be too critical of it.
But prosecutors in more conservative precincts in Colorado have vowed to press ahead with existing marijuana cases and are still citing people for possession.
They say that Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now recreationally.
Chief Oates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical marijuana growers, and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
Right now, 119 people face charges of possessing two ounces or less of marijuana, though many are facing other charges.
Yes, ran, because I had been subject to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Well, recent reports suggest that a new generation of Right-of-centre students are suffering a similar persecution.

Even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but, to this day, hides behind an ill-deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
You will be getting to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novelistic telling, and this dramatis personae will function as your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, like one of his men and women, you are confused and bereft in the fog of war.

He describes "meat made of pressed rice boiled in mutton fat (and finished off with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato peel; shoes soled with wood."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American recognizes his own impulse toward savagery and declares about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men were intended for rather than to sit in easy chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, the evening paper or the best seller, and to pretend that such a veneer means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind your starched and studded shirt front."
Conversely a British soldier realizes that he will most likely die, and that no one will notice or care.
Other observations are about an old Europe falling away, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Mr. Englund writes, "a war between factories."
Mr. Englund discussed the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front.
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is supple but unshowy, perfectly suited to his humane task.
The best books about World War I have often been oblique, like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory," or novels, like Erich Maria Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front," rather than comprehensive histories.

The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including boroughwide task forces - scores of mobile officers who are usually used to flood high-crime neighborhoods.
The suit will list Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants, and counts eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latino women, as were most of the aides who lost their jobs.

In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat through a hearing before a judge, during which she was questioned about having had sex with her boyfriend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: he had spent much of the time leading up to his attack at his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social-networking sites.

Facebook's stash of personal information is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that the researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been doing for years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it lets you study people you couldn't approach with a clipboard on the street.
"We've found a way to identify kids at risk who would not otherwise be diagnosed." 
But Facebook's users know the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the trade off for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.

Scalia and Thomas dine with healthcare law challengers as court takes case
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court's conference over the case.
If they were, they arguably fell under code's Canon 4C, which states, "A judge may attend fund-raising events of law-related and other organizations although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or featured on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the sheer proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics-in-government activists.
Moreover, conservatives argue that it's Justice Elena Kagan who has an ethical issue, not Scalia and Thomas.

Luisa Maria Calderon alleges that drug traffickers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the governor's race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her bid for governor of Michoacan during violent state elections, and she alleged Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, looking ahead to next year."
